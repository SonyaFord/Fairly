# Fairly

Fairly is a SaaS platform enabling talent acquisition teams to quickly find and hire high quality diverse talent for their company. Fairly is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains React code.
My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality of the landing and blogs page. I was required to handle all the coding for the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities.

● Created service file that seamlessly connected front-end to the back-end, resulting in efficient data retrieval and thoroughly tested with Postman.

● Designed components in React to maximize aesthetics and functionality.

● Utilized styling with CSS and Bootstrap.

● Focused on best practices using proper naming convention and casing to avoid compiler issues with team member’s code.

● Maintained workflow using GitBash and GitHub for repo management.

● Created new branches to maintain organization throughout the project.

● Performed commits and pull requests to secure consistency and quality.
